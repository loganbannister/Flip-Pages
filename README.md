# Flip Pages
> The purpose of this project is to develop an app capable of turning the pages of a musician’s score subtly. The automatic page turner will allow the user to practice his/her music without being distracted by manually flipping the page. This report contains an overview of the project, all of the team’s requirements, impacts of the design, functional decomposition, information about testing of the design, and a bill of materials. The team’s primary focus is on constructing an easy-to-use app that consistently turns the page at the appropriate time.

## General Information
- Traditionally, sheet music is in the form of a multi-page document. When a musician reaches the final bar of a page, they need to either stop playing and turn to the next page or depend on someone else to turn the page for them when appropriate. Both methods can be very distracting; Such a distraction can make practice as well as performance more difficult due to the possible break in musical continuity or concentration. Dr. Samson Cheung who has picked up the piano after 30 years says that turning the pages is “Highly distractive” for musicians. A system is needed to mitigate a musician’s distraction of turning the pages of a musical score. The app will be designed with beginners in mind as expert musicians may not use sheet music.
- The objective of this project is to design an automatic page turner to help musicians turn the page of their scores while they are playing while minimizing the distraction to the musician. During the time playing the musical instruments, turning pages is either to have the musician turning it by hand or foot pedal or an assistant doing the page turning. The goal of our project is to use an interface that relies on the front camera of the device to detect specific page turning gestures such as head turning or eye gaze. We will also focus on developing an app for the phone or tablet with some specific software during the process to improve the accuracy, reliability, and security of the design. 
- For centuries, paper sheet music has been the primary way musicians have been able to learn and perform songs. Typically, musicians will turn the pages of the sheet music by hand or have a separate person doing the page-turning. However, this approach to turning sheet music pages can be a cause of distraction for musicians.
